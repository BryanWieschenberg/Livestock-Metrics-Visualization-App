This database holds information of goats, along with their traits and activities. We aimed to answer 7 key questions about goats and their birth weights using our views and queries, enabling the user to choose a variety of years, vaccines, and outputs for each question answered. The 7 questions are:

1. Birth weight comparisons for each year the data is available.
2. Lowest average, median average, high average and overall average.
3. The average age of the does that gave birth that year.
4. Average wt. of twins, triplets and singles â€“ comparison.
5. Birth weight differences between first year moms and older moms.
6. Kid number differences between first time moms and older moms.
7. Dam vaccines' effect on their kids' birth weight.
